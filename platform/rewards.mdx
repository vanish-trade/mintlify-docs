**Silent Rewards** are Vanish’s built-in loyalty mechanism, designed to return value to users who contribute to the platform’s liquidity and privacy set. Rewards are distributed automatically and proportionally, based on your activity.

---

- **Holding SOL** → Earn a proportional share of **2.5% of platform fees**, allocated according to the amount of SOL you hold within Vanish.
- **Trading tokens** → Earn a proportional share of **5% of trading fees**, based on your contribution to overall trading activity.

Your rewards accrue silently in the background. At any time, you can open the **Rewards** section in the widget to view your current balance, along with a history of total rewards earned.
