When a new user connects their wallet through your link, they are recorded as your referral. From that point forward, a portion of the fees generated by their trades is shared with you. 

The base referral reward is **20%**. For example, if a referred user pays \$10 in trading fees, you receive \$2. Earnings accumulate across all referred users and continue as long as they trade.

The program features **tiered commission increases** based on the total trading volume of your referrals. Once a milestone is reached, the increased rate is permanent:

- **\$25,000 referred volume** → 22% commission
- **\$100,000 referred volume** → 25% commission
- **\$500,000 referred volume** → 29% commission
- **\$1,500,000 referred volume** → 32.5% commission

Active traders benefit from a **Weekly Personal Boost**. If your own trading volume reaches at least \$10,000 in a given week (Monday–Sunday, UTC), your referral commission rate increases by **\+2.5%** for the entire following week.
