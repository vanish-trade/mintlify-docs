### 

To initiate shielding, first select the token you want to shield. Vanish supports shielding of SOL and any SPL token. After selecting the asset, enter the amount you wish to deposit into Vanish.

Once you’ve set the amount, click the Shield button to proceed. Your connected browser wallet will pop up, asking you to approve the transaction.

### 

Once your assets are shielded, they are inside Vanish’s shielded liquidity. You can now trade them anonymously within the platform. From the outside, an observer just sees that you deposited funds into the Vanish's dynamic network of wallets, but they cannot see what you do next with them.
