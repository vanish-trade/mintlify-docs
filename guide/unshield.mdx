### 

To initiate unshielding, first select the token you want to withdraw. Vanish supports unshielding of any asset you currently hold in your shielded balance. After selecting the token, enter the amount you wish to unshield back to your wallet.

Once you’ve set the amount, click the **Unshield** button to proceed. Your connected browser wallet will pop up, asking you to approve the transaction.

### 

Once your assets are unshielded, they leave Vanish’s shielded liquidity and return directly to your wallet. From the outside, an observer just sees that your wallet received funds from Vanish’s dynamic network of wallets, but they cannot see what trades produced those funds inside.
