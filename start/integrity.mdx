At the heart of Vanish’s balanced approach to privacy and compliance is a simple but effective mechanism: each user operates their own **single fixed deposit and withdrawal address**. Users cannot send private payments, or mask peer-to-peer transactions within the protocol.

At Vanish, the same wallet in, same wallet out system ensures:

- Verifiable links between all deposits and withdrawals
- No obfuscation of transaction origin to destination
- Address hopping is completely disabled

While trading activity remains shielded, the movement of funds in and out of Vanish maintains a clear, auditable path. Traders maintain protection over _what_ they trade only after funds are properly vetted and screened.

sanctions monitoring, ensuring no illicit funds enter or exit the protocol.

### **Industry Leading Compliance Partners**

**_Elliptic_**

The leading blockchain data and intelligence platform trusted by banks, FIs, governments, crypto native businesses and regulators for compliance, risk management and intelligence operations. Elliptic’s platform has the highest uptime, scalability and response times by a significant margin and supports market leading organizations such as Coinbase, Revolut, Binance and provides Vanish with real-time, multi-asset risk detection for AML compliance.

**_Range_**

On the backend, every transaction passing through Vanish is screened in real time to detect illicit exposure. Trusted by Jupiter, Solana, and PumpFun, Range is one of the leading blockchain security and intelligence platforms — and the market leader in Solana.

Range’s screening solution is natively cross-chain, so in addition to performing sanctions checks, it also flags known bad actors from other ecosystems. Backed by their [Cross-Chain Explorer](https://explorer.range.org/), Range currently tracks transactions across 90+ chains to provide complete visibility into asset flows.

This is the same technology that underpins the [Solana Transaction Security Standard](https://www.range.org/transaction-security) and secures every multisig on Squads Protocol, safeguarding over \$20B in assets. Acting as the control tower, Range delivers Vanish real-time screening, KYB/KYT analytics, and continuous sanctions monitoring, ensuring no illicit funds enter or exit the protocol.

Vanish is purpose-built to safeguard all traders from front-running, and alpha leakage, without compromising on preventing illicit funds from poisoning the protocol.

- Every deposit and withdrawal is screened in real time by Elliptic and Range to uphold a clean trading environment and deter illicit activity.
- Deposits are paused for 30 minutes allowing partners to update the latest forensic data before funds clear.
- Continuous checks via Elliptic and Range against OFAC and global sanctions lists detecting fraud and high‑risk wallets.
- Range provides KYB/KYT monitoring to flag high-risk counterparties and suspicious transaction patterns.
- Strict geo-blocking to prevent access from sanctioned or restricted regions.

By embedding these controls at the protocol level, Vanish ensures that compliance is not an afterthought but a foundational layer.

**_Turnkey_**

Vanish utilizes Turnkey for their scalable, industry leading wallet infrastructure, meaning **no wallet private keys are held by Vanish**. Turnkey’s Trusted Execution Environments (“**_TEEs_**”) manage all sensitive cryptographic operations, such as key generation, encryption, and digital signing. These TEEs, often referred to as secure enclaves, are hardware protected zones that operate in complete isolation from the rest of the system.

By integrating state-of-the-art infrastructure, Vanish’s partnership with Turnkey ensures that user funds are protected by cutting-edge security protocols without compromising UX.

**_Groom Lake_**

The Private Military Corporation of Crypto with veterans from the NSA and CIA, Groom Lake protects billions in DeFi assets and serves as Vanish’s eyes in the sky. Acting as a proactive defence partner, they safeguard operational security, monitor threats in real time, and deploy countermeasures beyond the blockchain to neutralize risks. From system penetration testing to incident response, Groom lake leverages global intelligence networks to keep Vanish secure against both technical exploits and coordinated adversaries.
