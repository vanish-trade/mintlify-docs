Vanish enables compliant private trading on Solana, designed for traders who value **privacy, speed, and security**. Every transaction on-chain is visible, leaving strategies vulnerable to front-running or unwanted exposure. Vanish changes this by introducing shielded execution, enabling **instant private swaps for abiding traders** while preventing misuse from bad actors.

---

- **Shield** — deposit into Vanish’s shielded liquidity, breaking the on-chain connection.
- **Trade** — execute swaps inside Vanish, accessing deep liquidity at market prices.
- **Unshield** — withdraw assets back to your wallet, returning the on-chain connection.

---

Under the hood, Vanish leverages smart trade routing across shielded liquidity sources to maintain trade privacy. Pricing and execution are competitive using leading aggregators, with the critical distinction that your wallet and strategies remain unlinkable on-chain.
